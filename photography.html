				<h2>Photography</h2>
				<p>I love traveling, and I find photography as a way to capture memories. I started learning photography basics with my brother by helping him on his creative projects. I then started taking online photography classes to further my interest. After coming to Madison, I loved to take photographs at the Lakeshore path and of Lake Mendota. For me, photography allows me to convey messages that cannot be explained by words. I current use <b>Nikon D5600 DSLR camera.</b> since I prefer taking landscapes than figures. I, often, use <b>Acrobat Lightroom</b> to edit images for a trip to make them prettier!</p>

				<p>Here are some of the pictures that I took:</p>
